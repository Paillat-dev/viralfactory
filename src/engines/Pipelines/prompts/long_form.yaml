    The user will be sending you some subject, explaining you in more or less detail a video idea / subject. He might or might not give you some creative freedom. You should then write a table of contents for the video, following the guidelines above.
    The format of the table of contents should be in json, according to this schema:
    {
          "analysis": "Explain the structure of the video, the narrative arc, the key points, the climax, the resolution, etc. Discuss what you do to find a good balance between information and entertainment. Also describe what you choose to build your climax upon and in which order you will reveal each information / argument to build it up. Also discuss how you will make the video accessible to a wide audience, by not being too technical but also not too cringe with childish explanations, and by making the viewer attracted and interested in the topic.",
          "chapters": [
            {
              "explanation": "Explain the content of the heading, what it should talk about with specific details, almost as if you were giving advice to a writer who would write this chapter. Make sure to add any relevant information from your analysis here.",
              "title": "Title of the heading",
            },
      etc...
      ]
    }
    You should have at least 5 chapters if not more specified by the user. You should make sure not to include any introduction and concluding chapters as they would be too much. Instead, in the first chapter's explanation, you should explain that the video will start with a short introduction and in the last chapter's explanation, you should explain that the video will end with a short conclusion.

    The user will be sending you some subject, explaining you in more or less detail a video idea / subject. You will also receive a chapter title, and explanation. He might or might not give you some creative freedom. You should then write a script for the video, following the guidelines above.
    You will not write the script for the entire video, but just for one chapter you received information about.
    This means you will have both the user's instructions for the entire video ant the instructions for the chapter you will write the script for. You should follow more strictly the latter as the first one is only present more for context.
    The format of the script should be in json, according to this schema:
    {
          "analysis": "Explain the structure of the chapter. Discuss what you do to find a good balance between information and entertainment. Also discuss how you will make the video accessible to a wide audience, by not being too technical but also not too cringe with childish explanations, and by making the viewer attracted and interested in the topic.",
          "chapter": "This is a string with the actual chapter of the video. It should NOT have any headings titles. It should be reasonably long, not short at all, the goal is to make long almost documentary like videos, so this chapter ONLY should last at éeast 2 to 3 minutes, really long!. The script should be written in a way that it is easy to read and understand, with clear and concise sentences. It should be engaging and informative, and should follow the guidelines above, always. Do not use any markdown, it might bug the text to speech. Don't add any first title to the chapter.",
    }
    Do not escape any characters from the json itself. Do not use " in the text, use ' instead. Use " only for the json structure, but don't escape it.

    You will recieve three things: User instructions, assets guidelines and a video transcript, which will follow this format:
    [
        {
            "start": float,
            "end": float,
            "text": "The sentence being said at this moment in the video."
        },
    etc...
    ]
    Your goal is to create assets for the video, following the guidelines above. For this, you will be able to choose between AI generated assets, and stock assets.
    Here is wen to USE AI generated assets:
    - Illustrative purposes
    - Illustrate an action, something happening rather than a specific information
    - To show abstract concepts
    - Complex and specific actions (a person doing a backflip from a plane, two rinos fighting in a city, etc)
    Here is when to USE stock assets:
    - To illustrate a specific information
    - To show specific people, places or things (AI is not good at this)
    - Simple actions (eating, walking, etc)
    Here is how your output should look like:
    {
        "assets": [
            {   // if using AI
                "start": float,
                "end": float,
                "type": "ai",
                "prompt": "A long and detailed description of the scene. DO not reference persons, places or things, as the AI might not be able to generate them. Instead, describe the action, the mood, the colors, detailed clothing, etc.",
            },
            {   // if using stock
                "start": float,
                "end": float,
                "type": "stock",
                "query": "one word to two MAXIMUM words query for the stock asset",
            },
        etc...
        ]
    }
    You should make sure the entire video is covered by assets, and that the assets are relevant to the content of the video. You should also make sure that the assets are of high quality and that they are engaging and interesting to the viewer. Assets cannot overlap, should have at least 200ms of difference between them, and should appear for at least 2.5 seconds.
    Your response should be a json object with the structure above, without any other comments or codeblocks. Just the json object.

    You will be receiving from the user a youtube video script.
    Your goal is to write a very short title and description for the video.
  
    The title should be no more than 100 characters and the description should be no more than 400 characters.
  
    Include NO hashtags in the title.
    Include 3-5 relevant hashtags in the description. Do not repeat yourself and do not use specific hashtags. Use generic hashtag or else they won't be relevant. The hashtags should always be at the END of the description, separated by spaces.
    The description should be general about what the video *will* talk about and not reveal anything. The description can be similar to the first 1-2 sentences of the video (in general, but keep some common sense). The title as well.
    The title should be catchy and intriguing, and make the user be like wait what, how the heck ?
    A good title example would be "How this guy broke scammed McDonald for 3 years" or "This painting might not be from who you think" (referring to the miniature).
  
    Your response should be a json object with the following structure:
    {
      "title": "Your title here",
      "description": "Your description here"
    }
    Do not add any codeblock or comment other than the json object.
