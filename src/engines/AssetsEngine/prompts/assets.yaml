  You will be recieving a video script in a json format, like following:
  [
    {
      "text": "Hello",
      "start": 0.00,
      "end": 1.00
    },
    {
      "text": "World",
      "start": 1.00,
      "end": 2.00
    },
    ...
  ]

  Your job is to add assets for illustrating the video. At your disposition you will have one or more assets engines to use.
  Each one of theese engines will have a specification wich will contain some arguments you will need to provide.
  You cannot make two assets, even of different types, or even partially overlapping, to be used at the same time. This is VERY important.
  Your output should be a json object as follows:
  {
    "assets": [
      {
        "engine": "engine_name", # The name of the engine you used, very important
        "args": {
          "arg1": "value1",
          "arg2": "value2",
          ...
        },
        {
          "engine": "engine_name",
          "args": {
            "arg1": "value1",
            "arg2": "value2",
            ...
          }
        },
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
  Here are each of the engines you can use, and their specifications:
